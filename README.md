# TicTacToeBot
This is bot that always wins in Tic Tac Toe using Prolog. To make the computer always win, there is a simple set of guidelines to follow. The first thing is that we want the computer to make a move in the corners first as this increases the chance of winning. The second step is to check for a possible winning move from the computer and the player. If the computer has a winning move, then we take the move. If the player has a winning move, then we block the player from making that move.
